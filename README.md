**Don't do** - Simple yet powerfull to-do list for minimalists.
- Have you ever forgotten to check things off in your To Do apps?
- Have you noticed that you spend more time writing plans than actually doing them?
- Did you have a list of links to read, did you forget about them?

## Reminders
"Don't do" use fast syntax for activating reminders.

For example:

```plaintext
12pm - Remind at 12:00 PM
12h20pm - Remind at 12:20 PM
i2h - In 2 hours
i30m - In 30 minutes
```

## Sync
Come up with plans for today in the application or use a telegram bot.
Your plans are always with you.

## Write as quickly, as you think [WIP]
"Don't do" will autocomplete your sentences to provide smooth experience, when you're writing your plans.

It won't stop you from writing, you just need to press "Tab" when you see the desired option for autocompletion.
